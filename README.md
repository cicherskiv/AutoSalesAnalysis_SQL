# AutoSalesAnalysis_SQL
This project analyzes auto sales data from a company using SQLite. I then transformed these queries into data visualizations using Tableau.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data/data

My goal was to analyze current sales trends to see where the company could expand and where they were possibly losing money.
Based on this, I created my KPIs and charts to answer common questions.

KPIs
--Find the number of total orders
--Calculate the total revenue
--Calculate the average time between orders
--What is the bestselling productline and productcode, based on order amount and revenue

Visualizations
--What are the top 5 countries who order the most?
--Which deal size makes up the largest percent of revenue?
--Which months are the bestselling months?
